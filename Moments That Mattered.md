As I look back on my life, I realize how those small, seemingly unimportant choices I've made without much thought have been like pebbles in a stream, shaping the course of my life. Sometimes, as I think about some of these choices, I feel a touch of regret, but they haven't erased the stars in my night sky of happiness. They've added intricate brush strokes to the canvas of my existence, leading to different landscapes, some with sunsets, and others with storms.


When I ponder these moments, it's like wandering through a vast forest, wondering about the various paths my life could have taken.  It brings to mind the words of a wise man, Robert Frost, who once said, "Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."


However, as I reflect, I've come to see the unique fabric of my life, with its vibrant threads of joy, love, and experience, each thread weaving into the fabric of my soul. These threads are like the notes in a song that plays in my heart, composing the unique melody of my life and leading me to this moment of reflection.

Life is an intricate puzzle, a series of doors, both grand and humble. Some of these doors may have led to entirely different gardens, but whether they would have been gardens of roses or thorns, I can't be certain. What I do know is that each choice, no matter how seemingly small, has played a role in crafting the mosaic that is my life, and for that, I am grateful.
