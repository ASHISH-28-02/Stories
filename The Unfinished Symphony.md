They say every day is a new beginning, but not for me. The laziness in my life has peaked to the point where I don't even want to wake up in the morning. I feel nothing but each day filled with regrets. Each morning, I repeatedly hit the snooze button, surrendering the precious hours that could have been a fresh start. Failing every day leaves you with a bad and stinking aftertaste. Failing to wake up at the right time, failing to finish my meal on time, failing to complete an assignment before the deadline, failing to follow a routine has created a big void in my life over time. This mere incompleteness has affected a great part of my happiness. Every day, I fail miserably while trying to banish this demon of procrastination from my castle of life. Setting a deadline for a task and not completing it on time affects my mental health in ways I can't even explain. I have tried to incorporate new habits to be free from this whirlpool of regrets, but being the procrastinator that I am, I was unable to be consistent with them. I have tried setting reminders and rewards to motivate me to be a prolific person, but I couldn't follow them due to this unending laziness that has captivated me. Failing is not a big deal, but failing to stop the failure is the worst experience one could ever feel. This failure to be consistently productive has swallowed my will to live and enjoy the present. I have lost many opportunities due to being a procrastinator. The frustration of knowing I had the potential and the dreams but lacked the discipline to pursue them is maddening. Despite numerous attempts to break free from the grip of procrastination, I feel like I am stuck in quicksand, sinking deeper with each passing day. Enough of this misery.

Deep down, I am aware of the fact that I can beat this laziness and procrastination if I put my mind and soul into it. These failures have now ignited a flame in me that wants to free me from this chain of misery and agony. I am aware that it will take a lot to be consistent, but now I am more determined than ever before to drive away this devil from my cocoon of happiness. I will make sure that I will no longer be a slave to my shallow, temporary happinesses that are defending me from the dreams and goals I have dreamt of. I know it will be a challenging journey for me to climb up the mountains, breaking all these strings tying me, but I am going to try even harder and make it work. I must keep my happiness alive.
