In 2016, I embarked on a unique journey as a devoted Kerala Blasters fan. Though I couldn't be in the stadium, my television screen became a portal to a world of passion, hope, and heartbreak.

The season was a rollercoaster of emotions, and our squad boasted talented individuals like Aaron Hughes, Cedric Hengbart, and Kervens Belfort. Every match brought with it a fresh wave of optimism. We believed, with unwavering conviction, that victory was just a heartbeat away.

Ian Hume, a true Blasters legend, played for the opposition that season, but his legacy with the club was indelible.His connection with the fans remained strong. We cheered for him and shared in his triumphs and setbacks, for his name was etched in our hearts.

Shaiju Damodaran, the passionate commentator, was our voice and our emotional anchor throughout this journey. His words resonated with our hopes and frustrations, and he made us feel like we were right there in the heart of the action. He captured the essence of each moment, turning matches into unforgettable memories.

The climax arrived in a heart-pounding final that culminated in a penalty shootout against ATK. Despite our valiant efforts, the championship eluded us, leaving a palpable sense of disappointment.

But as fans, we refused to waver. We continued to chant and support our team, fully aware that success was just a matter of time. The 2016 season may have been a tale of "almost," but it was also a testament to the unbreakable bond between the Blasters and their dedicated fans. It was a season that defined us, leaving us with cherished memories of resilience and unwavering loyalty.
